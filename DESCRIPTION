Title: Simulated Complexity Measure
Description: The Simulated Complexity Library simulates a set of complexity 
    measures using models generated by a meta-learning approach to decrease the 
    asymptotic computational complexity of the original measures for 
    classification problems. The simulation is made by the models generated by 
    the extraction of simple and efficient meta-features implemented by mfe 
    package. The measures are described in the paper Lorena et al. (2018) 
    <doi:10.1007/s10994-017-5681-1>.
